# Notes/Ideas About Mentoring

## Overview

Mentorship is a relationship between a mentor and one or more mentees that facilitates the transfer of knowledge to foster the personal and professional growth of all that are involved.

A mentorship program is typically used to develop leaders or teach specialized skills, improve employee retention, and on-board new hires.

An employee who’s looking to progress in their career will definitely need mentors.
A high-potential employee is most likely to succeed with a mentor’s guidance and support in the learning process.

### Mentorship Types

**Traditional** : An experienced professional (mentor) is paired with a less experienced mentee

**Peer** : The mentor is at a similar professional experience level, but with expertise in a subject area that their mentee/peer does not possess

**Group** : Allows for multiple individuals to be mentored by a more experienced individual

**Reverse** :  A highly experienced professional is paired with a younger professional. The younger professional mentors the experienced professional on new trends, technologies, and processes.


## Who's Involved?

A mentor is an individual that possesses experience and expertise who can help develop the career of a mentee.

The primary function of a mentor is to act as a coach and/or role model while providing advice, information, support, and encouragement to enhance a mentee’s professional performance and development.  Additionally, a mentor can serve as a sounding board and provide different perspectives for issues that a mentee may be experiencing. 

A good mentor is anyone you can learn something from who is willing to share their limited time with others.

### Traits and Responsibilities

## Importance and Usefulness

Mentoring helps employees cultivate the skills and behaviors required for their careers. It also helps them become more resilient in times of change, self-reliant in their careers, and responsible as self-directed learners.  Further, employees that are early in their careers need help understanding what it means to be a professional in their working environment.  Even experienced professionals can continue to hone their craft by being mentored by a more experienced individual (of any seniority level).

From an organizational perspective, mentorship helps: employees understand and settle into the corporate culture, improve employee satisfaction and retention, develop future leaders, and teach new skills across the organization.  Highly competent staff can be utilized to pass their knowledge to others who need to acquire specific skills and/or behaviors.

Successful mentorships often evolve into friendships with the mentor and mentee(s) learning and providing support for one another in future endeavors.

## Execution

A productive mentoring relationship requires a strong match between the mentor and mentee.  A great match for one person may be a bad match for another.

Critical elements that should be considered during the pairing process are: development goals, specific interests/skills, experiences, and location.
Mentees should be included in the matching process by allowing them to request a particular mentor or their top three mentors.

Pairing a less-experienced employee (or new hire) with more experienced individuals can be a great opportunity for the employee to see how their current skills can be enhanced for real-life work scenarios.

Connecting a potential manager with a more experienced leader can help the potential manager get to know more about the nature of the work, required skills, and processes that must be learned to become a successful leader.  On the flip side, an existing manager could be paired with an experienced staffer to better understand the department’s operations and the staff’s work environment.

Mentors should be assigned to a mentorship for a specified amount of time.  
Initial contact with a mentee must occur within one week of assignment.  Communication activites with a mentee need to be frequent enough to keep the relationship current and strong.  A recommended cadence is at least once every two weeks.
